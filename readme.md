# Hotdog Not Hotdog

Inspired by HBO's Silicon Valley, this project recreates the AI which can detect whether or not a picture is or is not a hotdog. Using 
various architectures as well as pretrained models, I set out to find which model performs the best in catching hotdogs. The data used to train this
model was collected from various publically available subreddits.
